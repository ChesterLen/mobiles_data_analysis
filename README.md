📱 **Smartphone Dataset Analysis**

📌 Project Overview

This project performs data analysis on a smartphone dataset to extract meaningful insights, including weight trends, RAM size distributions, and brand comparisons. The dataset contains various attributes such as Mobile Weight, Battery Capacity, Screen Size, RAM, and Brand Name.

📂 Repository Structure

    This repository contains Python scripts to analyze smartphone data:

    average_weight_smartphones_per_brand.py - Computes the average smartphone weight for each brand.

    brand_that_offers_the_lightest_smartphones_on_average.py - Identifies the brand that produces the lightest smartphones on average.

    correlation_between_battery_capacity_and_mobile_weight.py - Examines the correlation between battery capacity and mobile weight.
    
    most_common_screen_size.py - Determines the most common screen size among smartphones.
    
    top_3_brands_with_the_most_smartphone_models.py - Finds the top 3 brands with the highest number of smartphone models.
    
    top_5_heaviest_smartphones.py - Identifies the top 5 heaviest smartphones in the dataset.
    
    top_5_lightest_smartphones.py - Identifies the top 5 lightest smartphones in the dataset.
    
    trends_ram_size.py - Analyzes trends in RAM sizes among smartphones.
